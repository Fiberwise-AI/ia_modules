Key Testing Strategies
Mocking: Use pytest fixtures for external dependencies (Redis, PostgreSQL, LLMs)
Parameterization: Use @pytest.mark.parametrize for multiple input scenarios
Integration Tests: Test component interactions, not just units
Error Paths: Explicitly test exception handling and edge cases
Async Testing: Use pytest-asyncio for async code paths
Test Data Builders: Create factories for complex test objects
