# Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Types of Neural Networks

### 1. Feedforward Neural Networks
The simplest type where information moves in one direction from input to output.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images.

### 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Designed for sequential data with connections that loop back.

### 4. Transformers
Modern architecture using attention mechanisms, powering models like GPT and BERT.

## Training Process

1. **Forward Pass**: Data flows through the network to generate predictions
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare predictions with actual values
3. **Backpropagation**: Calculate gradients of the loss
4. **Weight Update**: Adjust weights using gradient descent

## Applications

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
