All changes are **backward compatible**. No breaking changes.

**New Features (Optional)**:

1. **Add loops to your pipelines**:
   ```json
   {
     "flow": {
       "transitions": [
         {"from": "step_a", "to": "step_b"},
         {"from": "step_b", "to": "step_a", "condition": {...}}
       ]

       "max_iterations": 10,
       "max_loop_time_seconds": 300
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Validate loops**:
   ```bash
   ia-modules validate your_pipeline.json
   ```

3. **Check for loops programmatically**:
   ```python
   if pipeline.has_loops():
       loops = pipeline.get_loops()
   ```

### 🔗 Migration Guide

#### From v0.0.1 to v0.0.2

All changes are **backward compatible**. No breaking changes.

**Optional Upgrades**:

1. **Add CLI validation to your workflow**:
   ```bash
   ia-modules validate your_pipeline.json --strict
   ```

2. **Add benchmarking**:
   ```python
   from ia_modules.benchmarking import BenchmarkRunner
   runner = BenchmarkRunner()
   result = await runner.run("my_pipeline", execute_pipeline)
   ```

3. **Use built-in plugins**:
   ```python
   from ia_modules.plugins import auto_load_plugins
   auto_load_plugins()

   # Now use in pipeline conditions
   {
     "condition": {
       "type": "plugin",
       "plugin": "business_hours"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Create custom plugins**:
   ```python
   from ia_modules.plugins import condition_plugin, ConditionPlugin

   @condition_plugin(name="my_condition", version="1.0.0")
   class MyCondition(ConditionPlugin):
       async def evaluate(self, data):
           return data.get('value', 0) > 10
   ```
