      "config": {...},
      "position": {"x": 250, "y": 0}
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "step1",

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd showcase_app/backend
python main.py
```

Backend runs on: `http://localhost:5555`

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd showcase_app/frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Test Flow
1. Navigate to **Pipelines** page
2. Click **Execute** on any pipeline
3. Go to **Execution Details** page
4. **Watch real-time updates** via WebSocket:
   - Execution starts
   - Each step starts/completes
   - Final completion status
5. **Click on any step card** to open detailed view
6. **Explore tabs**:
   - Overview - metrics and timeline
   - Input - JSON tree view
   - Output - JSON tree view
   - Diff - side-by-side comparison
   - Logs - execution logs
