**Database:** postgresql://ia_user:ia_password@localhost:5433/ia_modules

## Summary

- **Total Issues Found:** 1
- **High Severity:** 1
- **Medium Severity:** 0
- **Low Severity:** 0

## Issues Found

### 1. Completed executions with zero completed_steps [HIGH]

**Count:** 1 records

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT execution_id, pipeline_name, status, total_steps, completed_steps, failed_steps,
               started_at, completed_at
        FROM pipeline_executions
        WHERE status = 'completed' AND completed_steps = 0
        ORDER BY started_at DESC
        LIMIT 10;
```

## Statistics

## Recommended Tests

### Unit Tests

### Integration Tests

#### `test_execution_step_counting`
Verify that completed_steps is accurately tracked during pipeline execution

```python
async def test_execution_step_counting():
    # TODO: Implement test
    pass
```

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix high-severity issues immediately
2. Implement recommended unit and integration tests
3. Run this validation script regularly (e.g., in CI/CD)
4. Add database constraints to prevent future issues
5. Update `_save_execution_to_db()` to fix step counting
