- **Column Width**: 65px per time unit
- **Row Height**: 40px for readability
- **Bar Corner Radius**: 4px for modern look
- **Header Height**: 50px with clear labels

### Color Scheme
```javascript
Completed: Green (#10b981 → #047857)
Failed:    Red (#ef4444 → #991b1b)
Running:   Yellow (#f59e0b → #92400e)
Pending:   Gray (#9ca3af → #374151)
```

### Responsive Design
- Horizontal scroll for long timelines
- Flexible width adaptation
- Mobile-friendly metrics grid
- Clear typography hierarchy

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "gantt-task-react": "^0.3.9"
}
```

**Includes**:
- Gantt chart component
- Built-in zoom/pan controls
- Timeline rendering engine
- Task progress visualization

---

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Data Transformation
```javascript
// Convert execution steps to Gantt tasks
const ganttTasks = steps.map((step, index) => ({
  id: step.name || `step-${index}`,
  name: step.name || `Step ${index + 1}`,
  start: new Date(step.start_time),
  end: new Date(step.end_time || Date.now()),
  progress: getStepProgress(step),
  type: 'task',
  styles: getTaskStyles(step.status)
}));
```

### Progress Calculation
- Completed: 100%
- Running: 50%
- Failed: 100% (with error styling)
- Pending: 0%

### Duration Formatting
- < 60s: "Xs"
- < 60m: "Xm Ys"
- >= 60m: "Xh Ym"

## 🔄 Integration with Other Features

**Works seamlessly with**:
- ✅ StepDetailPanel - Click steps for detailed info
- ✅ TelemetrySpans - Correlate timeline with traces
- ✅ CheckpointList - See checkpoint creation times
- ✅ ReplayComparison - Compare timelines across replays
- ✅ DecisionTimeline - Align decisions with execution

## 📊 Example Use Cases

### 1. Performance Optimization
```
User sees step "Data Processing" takes 5 minutes
→ Clicks step for details
→ Reviews input/output sizes
→ Optimizes data chunking
```

### 2. Failure Investigation
```
Pipeline fails at "Validation" step
→ Timeline shows it ran 30 seconds
→ Check previous step outputs
→ Identify malformed data
```

### 3. Production Monitoring
```
Daily batch job running
→ Timeline shows real-time progress
→ Compare to historical durations
→ Alert if anomalies detected
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient memoization with useMemo
- Only re-render on execution changes
- Lightweight task transformation
- Optimized for 100+ steps

### Edge Cases Handled
- No execution data: Show empty state
- No steps: Display helpful message
- Missing timestamps: Use fallback dates
- Running steps: Update end time to now
- Ensure positive duration (minimum 1 second)

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color + text status indicators
