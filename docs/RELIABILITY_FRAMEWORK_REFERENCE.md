# Agent Reliability Framework - Research Reference

## Overview

This document captures the research concepts that informed the reliability and observability features in IA Modules. These concepts come from Sarah Payne's article "Evaluability and Observability for AI Agents" and related agent system research.

**Note**: This is a reference document only. The actual implementation in IA Modules is original work that implements these concepts in our pipeline framework.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Evaluability

**Definition**: The ability to reconstruct and judge any agent decision after the fact.

**Key Requirements**:
- Complete decision history with reasoning
- Separation of verified facts from agent claims
- Evidence tracking with confidence levels
- Goal and plan tracking
- Ability to explain decisions in human-readable format

**Implementation in IA Modules**:
- `DecisionTrail` system with `Evidence`, `StepRecord`, `ToolCall`, `StateDelta`
- Three confidence levels: verified, claimed, inferred
- `DecisionTrailBuilder.explain_decision()` for Markdown explanations
- State versioning and checkpoint metadata

**Target Metric**: MTTE ≤ 5 minutes (Mean Time to Explain any decision)

### 2. Observability

**Definition**: Real-time visibility into agent behavior and performance.

**Key Requirements**:
- Step-by-step execution tracking
- Tool call logging with parameters and results
- State change tracking (before/after deltas)
- Execution path visibility
- Error tracking with context

**Implementation in IA Modules**:
- `StateManager` with versioning and rollback
- `ToolRegistry` with execution logging (timestamp, duration)
- Execution path tracking in `AgentOrchestrator`
- Comprehensive error handling with `PipelineError` hierarchy

### 3. Reproducibility

**Definition**: The ability to replay agent decisions for debugging and verification.

**Key Requirements**:
- Capture all inputs, outputs, and tool calls
- Support for exact reproduction (strict mode)
- Support for simulated replay (mocked tools)
- Support for counterfactual analysis (what-if scenarios)
- Difference detection and classification

**Implementation in IA Modules**:
- `Replayer` class with three replay modes
- `ReplayResult` with difference tracking
- `ReplayMode`: STRICT, SIMULATED, COUNTERFACTUAL
- Outcome comparison with significance levels

**Target Metric**: RSR ≥ 99% (Replay Success Rate)

## Reliability Metrics

### 1. Step Validity Rate (SVR)

**Definition**: Percentage of agent steps that succeed without errors.

**Formula**: `SVR = successful_steps / total_steps`

**Target**: >95%

**Why It Matters**: Indicates overall agent reliability. Low SVR suggests agent is frequently failing.

**Implementation**:
```python
svr = await metrics.get_svr(agent="coder")
```

### 2. Compensation Rate (CR)

**Definition**: Percentage of steps requiring rollback or undo operations.

**Formula**: `CR = compensated_steps / total_steps`

**Target**: <10%

**Why It Matters**: Tracks how often agents make mistakes requiring correction. High CR indicates poor planning or validation.

**Implementation**:
```python
await metrics.record_step(
    agent="planner",
    success=True,
    required_compensation=True  # Step needed rollback
)
cr = await metrics.get_cr()
```

### 3. Plan Churn (PC)

**Definition**: Average number of retries per workflow.

**Formula**: `PC = total_retries / total_workflows`

**Target**: <2

**Why It Matters**: Measures planning stability. High PC suggests agents are frequently re-planning.

**Implementation**:
```python
await metrics.record_workflow(
    workflow_id="wf-123",
    steps=10,
    retries=2  # Workflow retried twice
)
pc = await metrics.get_pc()
```

### 4. Human Intervention Rate (HIR)

**Definition**: Percentage of workflows requiring human approval or intervention.

**Formula**: `HIR = workflows_requiring_human / total_workflows`

**Target**: <5%

**Why It Matters**: Measures agent autonomy. High HIR means system isn't truly autonomous.

**Implementation**:
```python
await metrics.record_workflow(
    workflow_id="wf-456",
    required_human=True  # Needed approval
)
hir = await metrics.get_hir()
```

### 5. Mode Adherence (MA)

**Definition**: Percentage of steps where agent's actual behavior matches declared mode.

**Formula**: `MA = (total_steps - mode_violations) / total_steps`

**Target**: >90%

**Why It Matters**: Ensures agents follow declared behavior (explore/execute/escalate). Low MA indicates unpredictable behavior.

**Implementation**:
```python
await metrics.record_step(
    agent="executor",
    mode="explore",        # Actual mode
    declared_mode="execute"  # Declared mode
)
ma = await metrics.get_ma()
```

## Agent Modes

### Explore Mode

**Purpose**: Research and information gathering without taking actions.

**Characteristics**:
- Read-only operations
- Can call search/lookup tools
- Cannot modify state or external systems
- Should declare uncertainty

**Example Use Cases**:
- Initial research
- Gathering requirements
- Analyzing options

### Execute Mode

**Purpose**: Take concrete actions based on established plans.

**Characteristics**:
- Can modify state and external systems
- Should have high confidence
- Should validate before acting
- Should be reversible when possible

**Example Use Cases**:
- Implementing code
- Creating resources
- Executing approved plans

### Escalate Mode

**Purpose**: Request human intervention for uncertain or high-stakes decisions.

**Characteristics**:
- Pause execution
- Present options with reasoning
- Wait for human approval
- Continue after approval

**Example Use Cases**:
- Ambiguous requirements
- High-risk operations
- Conflicting constraints

## Evidence System

### Confidence Levels

1. **Verified** (Highest confidence)
   - Source: External tools, APIs, databases
   - Examples: API responses, database reads, file contents
   - Trustworthy: Yes, can be independently verified

2. **Claimed** (Medium confidence)
   - Source: Agent outputs (LLM generations)
   - Examples: Plans, reasoning, analysis
   - Trustworthy: Requires validation

3. **Inferred** (Lowest confidence)
   - Source: Derived from other evidence
   - Examples: Conclusions, predictions, assumptions
   - Trustworthy: Depends on source evidence

### Evidence Types

- `tool_result`: Output from external tool
- `database_read`: Data from database query
- `api_response`: Response from API call
- `user_input`: Input provided by user
- `agent_claim`: Claim made by agent

## SLO Targets

### Mean Time to Explain (MTTE)

**Definition**: How long it takes to reconstruct and explain any agent decision.

**Target**: ≤5 minutes

**How to Measure**:
```python
start = time.time()
trail = await builder.build_trail(thread_id)
explanation = await builder.explain_decision(trail)
mtte = time.time() - start
```

### Replay Success Rate (RSR)

**Definition**: Percentage of decisions that can be successfully replayed.

**Target**: ≥99%

**How to Measure**:
```python
total_attempts = 0
successful_replays = 0

for trail in decision_trails:
    total_attempts += 1
    result = await replayer.strict_replay(trail)
    if result.success:
        successful_replays += 1

rsr = successful_replays / total_attempts
```

## Design Patterns

### 1. State Versioning

**Pattern**: Track every state change with before/after values.

**Benefits**:
- Enables rollback
- Provides audit trail
- Supports decision reconstruction

**Implementation**:
```python
class StateManager:
    def set(self, key, value):
        old_value = self._state.get(key)
        self._versions.append({
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
            "key": key,
            "old_value": old_value,
            "new_value": value
        })
        self._state[key] = value
```

### 2. Tool Call Logging

**Pattern**: Log every tool execution with parameters, results, and timing.

**Benefits**:
- Enables replay
- Provides debugging context
- Tracks tool usage

**Implementation**:
```python
timestamp = datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
start_time = time.time()

result = await tool.function(**parameters)

duration = time.time() - start_time
execution_log.append({
    "tool": tool_name,
    "parameters": parameters,
    "result": result,
    "timestamp": timestamp,
    "duration": duration
})
```

### 3. Evidence Extraction

**Pattern**: Automatically extract evidence from tool results and agent outputs.

**Benefits**:
- Builds decision trail automatically
- Separates facts from claims
- Provides confidence scores

**Implementation**:
```python
def extract_evidence(tool_result):
    return Evidence(
        type="tool_result",
        source=tool_name,
        content=tool_result,
        confidence="verified",  # Tools are verified
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    )
```

5. **Evidence Types**: Extended beyond research definitions
6. **Metrics Storage**: Pluggable storage interface

## Future Enhancements

Based on research concepts not yet implemented:

1. **SLOTracker**: Automated MTTE and RSR measurement
2. **ModeEnforcer**: Enforce explore/execute/escalate modes
3. **EvidenceCollector**: Automatic evidence extraction from all sources
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Detect unusual agent behavior
5. **Trend Analysis**: Track metrics over time
6. **Alerting**: Alert on metric violations

## Conclusion
